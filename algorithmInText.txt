	1. Start

	2. Input a word

	3. If the length of the word is less than or equal to 1, 
   		return True (Stop condition)

	4. Initialize left pointer to the first character (0th index)

	5. Initialize right pointer to the last character (length-1 index)

	6. While left pointer is less than right pointer

     		a. If the characters at the left and right pointers are equal, 
     		move the left pointer one position right and right pointer one position left

     		b. If the characters at the left and right pointers are not equal, return False

	7. If the loop completes, return True

	8. End
